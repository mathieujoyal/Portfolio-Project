# Mathieu's BIG BRAIN moves and thought processes
The story of how this masterpiece came to be.

## In the beggining, there was nothing. Then, Greatness manifested.

So I took inspiration from one of the first projects I made with react that I had alot of fun with, the structure revolved around making a fruit shop and since I love apples and have a burning hatred for bananas, I decided that I would try to recreate something similar (in terms of structure of course. I'm unfortunately not sponsored to sell any fruits.)

I used the react features to implement multiple page ( react router, routes, route ) and inserted a header component that would be rendered through the entire website to facilitate navigation.

### I took a break to make it all pretty

After the functionality was spot on, it was time to add some ✨PZAZ✨ to the whole thing. I spent some time deciding the color scheme for the whole thing starting with my header since it will be showing the entire time (which i'm still not too sure about). Then i got to work on some animations for said header to make it less plain and basic.

### 1 week later

FINALLY found my color scheme. i went for a black and green color scheme since i feel like its a pretty good color combo and it matches the stereotypical "coding" colors that you see in the movies.

I had to asdjust most of the styling to make it responsive on EVERY size of screen (within reason). That was challenging especially for the toothpick thin screen that is the commonly found on a ✨GALAXY FOLD✨.
I made sure to use percentages and reasonably small padding/width/margins etc.. to have it always be responsive.

Once that was done, i got to work on the navigation button when the screen is small enough and i decided to make it link to a Full screen naviagtion bar type thing. (it kinda looks like a drop down menu but its a whole new page. Dont tell anyone please)

Then i decided to put some more React on it by using the famous .map method on my project page. It worked flawlessly.

I also took some time to add some animation on most of my page's text and boxes to give it a neon-sign style of animation on startup. Also gave my profile picture a totally rad 360 degree spin and bounce effect.
