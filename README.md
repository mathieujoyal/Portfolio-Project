# Mathieu's BIG BRAIN moves and thought processes
The story of this masterpiece came to be.

## In the beggining, there was nothing. Then, Greatness manifested.

So I took inspiration from one of the first projects I made with react that I had alot of fun with, the structure revolved around making a fruit shop and since I love apples and have a burning hatred for bananas, I decided that I would try to recreate something similar (in terms of structure of course. I'm unfortunately not sponsored to sell any fruits.)

I used the react features to implement multiple page ( react router, routes, route ) and inserted a header component that would be rendered through the entire website to facilitate navigation.

### I took a break to make it all pretty

After the functionality was spot on, it was time to add some PZAZ to the whole thing. I spent some time deciding the color scheme for the whole thing starting with my header since it will be showing the entire time (which i'm still not too sure about). Then i got to work on some animations for said header to make it less plain and basic.
